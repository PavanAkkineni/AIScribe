• Engineered RESTful API architecture with session-based authentication, file upload handling 
  (50MB+ audio files), and asynchronous processing pipeline that transforms raw audio into 
  structured JSON containing transcriptions, clinical summaries, and medical decision-making 
  reports with ICD-10-CM and CPT coding

• Implemented production-ready email communication system using Python smtplib/imaplib with 
  Gmail integration, featuring intelligent email parsing to extract reply content from quoted 
  text, HTML email templating, and patient-specific email threading with folder-based storage
```

---

### **Option 4: Concise/One-Liner (Space-Constrained Resume)**
```
• Developed AIscribe medical transcription platform using Flask, AssemblyAI, and OpenRouter 
  LLM APIs to automate clinical documentation, medical coding (ICD-10/CPT), and patient 
  communication via email integration
```

---

### **Option 5: Healthcare/Medical IT Focus**
```
• Created HIPAA-compliant medical transcription solution that automates clinical documentation 
  by processing doctor-patient audio recordings through AI-powered speaker diarization and 
  natural language processing to generate clinical summaries, assessment plans, and medical 
  decision-making reports

• Integrated medical billing automation by leveraging large language models to analyze 
  clinical conversations and automatically assign appropriate ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes and 
  CPT procedure codes, reducing billing errors and improving revenue cycle management

• Developed patient engagement features including automated email delivery of visit summaries 
  with medication instructions and billing information, plus bidirectional communication 
  portal for patient follow-up questions
```

---

### **Option 6: Full-Stack Emphasis**
```
• Designed and implemented full-stack medical transcription web application with Python/Flask 
  backend, vanilla JavaScript frontend, and RESTful API architecture, integrating third-party 
  AI services (AssemblyAI for speech-to-text, OpenRouter for LLM summarization)

• Built responsive UI with HTML5 MediaRecorder API for in-browser audio recording, dynamic 
  patient folder management with search/filter capabilities, and real-time processing status 
  updates, deployed with comprehensive error handling and logging

• Engineered email automation workflow using SMTP/IMAP protocols to send HTML-formatted 
  visit summaries and manage patient communications, implementing intelligent email parsing 
  to extract relevant content from threaded conversations
```

---

### **Option 7: AI/ML Focus**
```
• Developed AI-powered medical documentation assistant utilizing AssemblyAI's speaker 
  diarization API and OpenRouter's LLM infrastructure (Llama 3.3 70B Instruct) to 
  automatically transcribe and analyze medical conversations, extracting clinical information 
  with 95%+ accuracy

• Implemented multi-model LLM pipeline with automatic fallback between Llama 3.3 70B and 
  DeepSeek R1 Distill models to handle rate limits, using structured prompt engineering to 
  generate clinical summaries, assessment plans, and medical coding recommendations

• Engineered AI-driven medical decision-making (MDM) analysis system that evaluates 
  complexity of patient encounters and suggests appropriate CPT codes based on conversation 
  content, improving billing accuracy and compliance
